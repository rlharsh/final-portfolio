# Professional Goals

## Mastery of Full-Stack Development

While I currently have a very strong foundation in front-end technologices, particularly in React, my current goal is to become equally proficient with back-end technologies. I would really like to gain knowledge, and perhaps master: **Node.js**, **Express**, and other database management systems, that will allo me to deliver more comprehensive end-to-end solutions.

## Contribute to Open Source projects

Currently, open source projects are the very backbone of the web-development community, and I aspire to contribute more openly to these projects. Not only as a way to give back to a community who has given me so much, but also so that I may refine my coding skills and collaborate with fellow developers from all walks of life around the world.

## Continuous Learning and Certification

As I have previously mentioned several times, it is my goal to help bridge the divide between **technology** and **humanity**. Therefore, I plan to regularly enroll in more advanced courses and continue earning certifications, particularly in emerging technologies such as **AI** and **blockchain**, that I may use the skills I acquire to help others, and to build everyday things for everyday people.
