# My Skills

Skills are an important aspect of what I do, and each day I strive to make progress in learning new, valuable skills that assist me to deliver quality content. Some of my most valuable skills are:

**React**: One of the first libraries that I embraced early on in my professional development journey, React is what helps me build **immersive** and **dynamic** web-applications (in fact, the website you are looking at now was built using **vite** & **React**).

**SASS**: SAAS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet) for me is an absolute game-changer for me. As my preferred **_CSS_** pre-processor, it helps me streamline my styling process, allowing me to write cleaner, more maintainable code, and **save time** without having to sacrifice the sophistication of the design.

**JavaScript**: JavaScript often dubbed the **programming language of the web**, JavaScript is my favorite programming language due to its versitility and power. By working with JavaScript, it pushes me to refine my problem-solving skills continuously, whether I'm breathing life into new concepts or creating detailed web functionalities.
