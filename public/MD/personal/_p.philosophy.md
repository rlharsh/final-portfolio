# Personal Philosophy

## Technology

At the core of my professional journey lies a very simple yet powerful belief: 'Technology as a Tool for **Development**'. This philosophy helps guide every aspect of my work as a web-developer, and a person.

I believe that all technological forms, at their best, should not be just a showcase of complexity or innovation, but a means to make life **easier**, more **productive**, and more **enjoyable**. My approach to web development is grounded in developing solutions that are not just technically robust, but are also intuitive and accessible to all users, regardless of their technical apptitude.

## Humanity

I believe that all of life is important, and that each and every person should have access to technologies that will help to enrich their life. I **firmly** believe that technology should be open, and those without the means to afford said technology should not be barred simply for being what they are.

I have a firm appreciation for open-source projects, as they are the very backbone of not just web-development, but I believe that open-source projects lead to new innovations, new ideas and the betterment of society as a whole. By providing more open-source projects to the community, we are ensuring that people from all walks of life will have access to the very same materials that we all enjoy.
