# My Skills

Skills are an important aspect of what I do, and each day I strive to make progress in learning new, valuable skills that assist me to deliver quality content. Some of my most valuable skills are:

## Front-End Skills

**React**: One of the first libraries that I embraced early on in my professional development journey, React is what helps me build **immersive** and **dynamic** web-applications (in fact, the website you are looking at now was built using **vite** & **React**).

**SASS**: SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet) for me is an absolute game-changer for me. As my preferred **_CSS_** pre-processor, it helps me streamline my styling process, allowing me to write cleaner, more maintainable code, and **save time** without having to sacrifice the sophistication of the design.

**JavaScript**: JavaScript often dubbed the **programming language of the web**, JavaScript is my favorite programming language due to its versitility and power. By working with JavaScript, it pushes me to refine my problem-solving skills continuously, whether I'm breathing life into new concepts or creating detailed web functionalities.

**HTML5**: HTML5 is the latest & greatest iteration of **HTML**, the language that is responsible for structuring and presenting content on the **World Wide Web**. I have a very strong understanding of semantic HTML, and carefully code each element with care and dedication, ensuring that my creations are up-to-par with the latest standards.

**Responsive Design**: I adopt a **mobile-first** development process, and build out applications to fit a broad array of devices. My designs are scalable to all resolutions, and are guaranteed to look great on **any device**.

## Soft Skills

**Problem Solving**: When dealing with problems, I ensure that I take my time, break down a large-problem into smaller parts, and search for the best resolution for the individual case.

**Communication**: Communication is key in any project, and in my daily life. I personally feel that communciation can make the difference between success and failure, and I ensure to always communicate changes so that all of my projects are **on-time** and exactly how they are supposed to be.

**Teamwork**: Without teamwork, there cannot be great success. Therefore, to me teamwork plays a very important role in my **professional** and personal life.
