# Personal Summary

Hello, my name is **Ronald Harsh**, and I am glad that you have made it this far, and I'd like to tell you a little more about who I am as an individual.

## Personal Life

Growing up in an international household, I've always cherished the value of diverse perspectives and the transformative power of education. This belief steered me towards web development, driven by a commitment to create accessible and enriching online resources.

## Before Development

My life took an unconventional route. Starting as a semi-professional wrestler at 17, I learned the art of resilience and self-expression. This chapter, though exciting, eventually led me to explore other avenues. I ventured into customer service, where I honed my interpersonal skills and discovered a love for technology. This passion for tech later ignited my interest in C# programming, culminating in several successful projects by 2013.

## Fast Forward

A decade later, as a family man seeking a sustainable career, I dove headfirst into web development. My enrollment in college as an adult student, maintaining a 4.0 GPA, reflects my dedication to this new path. Today, I'm fully immersed in the world of development, continuously learning and growing in the field.

## My Aspiration

What drives me now is the desire to showcase my capabilities, to rise above limitations, and to embrace the challenges of this dynamic field. My wrestling years taught me perseverance, and I bring that fighting spirit to my web development career, eager to make a meaningful impact.
